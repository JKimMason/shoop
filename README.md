# shoop
SCP for the modern era. If I were better at marketing I might call this "insanely" fast.

**DO NOT USE THIS FOR SECURITY SENSITIVE MATERIAL**.

THIS IS A PREVIEW.

# what's it do
Shoop is a high-speed encrypted file transfer tool reminiscent of scp. It uses SSH to bootstrap authentication and encryption, then uses UDT (a reliable protocol from the 2000s) instead of TCP (a reliable protocol from the 1970s).

It is **particularly** useful in connections that are "bursty".

From Vietnam, for example, it typically speeds up my downloads by about 2x, if not more for larger files.

# install
at the moment, I'm not distributing binaries until this is more stable.

* install rust (I recommend [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/))
* install libsodium (this is temporary until libsodium 1.0.11 is released and https://github.com/dnaq/sodiumoxide/pull/135 is merged). 
  * **macOS**: `brew install libsodium`
  * **everyone else**: i believe in you (https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium)
  
```
git clone https://github.com/mcginty/shoop
cd shoop
cargo build --release
target/release/shoop <remote-host>:<remote-path>
```

# your typical performance example
```
‚òÅ  shoop [master] ‚ö° time scp host-in-germany:~/125mb.file .
1.65s user 2.20s system 2% cpu 2:15.39 total
‚òÅ  shoop [master] ‚ö° time shoop host-in-germany:~/125mb.file
2.39s user 4.53s system 8% cpu 1:18.53 total
```

# why should i use it
* It deals with unreliable/shoddy connections much more gracefully
* It survives network interruptions

# but isn't there tool X, Y, and Z already for this?
no, actually, not really.
